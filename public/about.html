<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate web developer with a keen eye for design and a love for crafting seamless user experiences. My journey in web development began with a fascination for how the web works and has since evolved into a fulfilling career where I get to build functional and visually appealing websites.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my hobbies. I have a deep passion for acting, which allows me to explore different characters and stories. Watching movies is another favorite pastime, as it inspires my creativity and provides endless ideas for my projects. I also enjoy studying various subjects, always eager to learn something new and expand my horizons.</p>

<p>Balancing my technical skills with my creative pursuits, I strive to bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. Whether it's developing a complex web application or diving into a new role in a play, I approach everything with enthusiasm and dedication.</p>
